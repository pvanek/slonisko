# Builds Slonisko.app with every library it needs inside it, and a disk image
# of it. Run from anywhere on a Mac with Homebrew; see tools/README.md.
#
# Environment:
#   SLONISKO_SIGN_IDENTITY  "Developer ID Application: ..." to sign for
#                           distribution; without it the bundle is signed
#                           ad hoc, which runs only where it was built.
#   SLONISKO_NOTARY_PROFILE a notarytool keychain profile; with it (and an
#                           identity) the disk image is notarised and stapled.
#   SLONISKO_WITH_DOCS      OFF to leave the manual out (default ON).
